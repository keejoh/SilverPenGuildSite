						Combat is a lot simpler than many would think. This is because combat is best told in short segments of action, which ends quickly. As well, combat scenes tend to be written very short, because prolonged combat can be boring, as it is a lot of the same, repetitive statements. However, slower combat is possible to do and make interesting, but it typically has a lot of pauses, with heavy dialogue to provide exposition for the combatants. 
                        <br><br>
                        Much of what combat accomplishes is a climax and an ending to a series of events. Most of the interesting elements derived from combat come post-combat. That is also true if the combat is a brief intermission with the story but is not a combat where one or the other side loses. A paused conflict, to be resumed later, can provide a lot of exposition and drive for characters. One example might be two rivals who were destined to battle. The protagonist is overpowered in the initial combat, but the battle is paused due to outside factors. The protagonist realizes that they are underwhelming compared to their rival, and that feeling spurs them on to train harder, and realize heights they would not have saw before.
                        <br><br>
                        It should also be noted that antagonists do not necessarily need to be overwhelmingly stronger than the protagonist. Indeed, combat does not need to solely revolve around power output. Combat can also take the form of outwitting the opposing force or doing a battle of words. A strong hero is just as good as a weak hero. The same can be said of the villain. What truly matters is not the strength of the forces, but how well they are written.
