					There are a few ways to figure out what you want to provide as a hook. One such way is by examining trending lists. You can find out what sorts of genres are most popular at a given time and thus, you are then able to draw in an audience simply by the merit of what is popular. However, this can be somewhat of a pitfall as well, and should be kept in mind. 
					<br><br>
					Two examples of this: If you were to start your project based solely on what is popular and then your project goes well beyond the projected finish date, then the popularity of the item may have declined, and then the potential worth of your product could significantly undersell. Though on the same vein, with the second example, if your product is solely based on popularity, and even if you do get it on the market during the popularity window, you may still have an issue when the subject is no longer popular. This can result in a lot of sales, followed by very little sales. Unless there is something beyond trending that is getting it to sell, it will drop off. It will also result in a potential loss of future interest as well, because people may associate the product with a one-hit wonder or the like.
                    <br><br>
                    One should ensure that their product is not shallow and has enough content or creativity involved to stand on its own merit. Using keywords is a good way to draw people’s attention, but then once you have their attention, you need to follow up by providing a reason for them to stay beyond the initial interest point. For example, if you were to use the title “Mysteries of Space”, you would want to focus first on something with a lot of substance and that is not dry as your opener. As well, it should generally be something that most can relate to, whether it be due to relating directly to everyday life, or because it is a common topic discussed within the topic at hand. Concerning space, black holes is a good example of something that is not relatable in day-to-day life but is rather fascinating to the population.
                    <br><br>
                    There is a common mistake that many writers do, which often goes overlooked, unless a spotlight is called upon it. That is that content creators often have too much investment into their works and believe some things may be arbitrary, when they are not. This results in things getting left out of a piece, that would turn an otherwise average product, into a stellar one. One of the most common examples of this lay with detailing something. You could describe an appliance in your kitchen as “a toaster” or you could describe it as “a toaster with blur trim, a white lever, and a dull pink exterior.” It is far easier to visualize what the second toaster is, compared to the first, in the mind’s eye. 
                    <br><br>
                    Often details seem like they can be omitted without anything lost. Sometimes this is true, certainly, but much of the time it is not. The reader may not immediately notice the lack of detail, but as they go along, they may bee that the picture they thought was clear is quite smudged, and much less discernable. Building a scene is paramount to drawing the reader in and keeping them invested. You want to be able to have your reader be able to think back and have a clear picture of what they experienced.
