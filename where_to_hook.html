					Knowing where to hook takes some practice. This is because you do not want to provide hooking in any sort of discernable pattern to the reader. With the exception being if your product has something like this in mind. One example would be how some T.V. shows have a preview of the next episode to come. However, let us take that concept out of the equation, and considering hooking in a general sense.  
					<br><br>
					Placing a strong hook at the beginning of the story is a good rule of thumb. The initial introduction to a story should have something that makes the reader want to go beyond the first few pages. First impressions matter, especially when it is considering whether they want to invest several hours to days of their time looking over what you have written. Although, beyond the first hook, things get much murkier as to where placement should be.
                    <br><br>
                    Patterns should be avoided, unless explicitly desired for a piece. This means that you want to avoid cycling between adding a hook in the middle, to the end, and back to the middle again, of a given chapter. This will eventually be picked up on by the reader, and a story will seem forced or at least, like it’s trying to sell the reader something. A story should be engaging and do have it be as such, the twists and turns need to surprise the reader enough that they are left slightly unexpecting, but not lost.
                    <br><br>
                    This can be accomplished by having overall guidelines for a chapter but ensuring that enough interesting things happen from start to finish, that regardless of chapter end, it felt like things changed in the story. In a work of fiction, this could be something along the lines of a side character finishing out what it was they were out to do early in the chapter, and then echoing it later in the story. Then finishing out the chapter with the primary character’s aspirations. In a work of academia, this might be offering a short side topic about a given subject that has some interesting elements and then continuing with the primary content afterwards. For example, if you were to be speaking about the universe from a science perspective, you could use small facts about our own planets to mirror some of what we have found out in space. This offers some insight into our own planets, painting a picture for the reader, but also still giving insight into the greater topic at hand, which is the universe.
