				<p class="heading">FAQs</p>
				<div class="description">

				<p class="firstLine">What is the longest word in the English language?</p>
				<p class="description1">Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis</p>				
				<p class="firstLine">Will people write a academic paper for me?</p>
				<p class="description1">No, but we will instruct on how a vowel should not follow another vowel. Instead, if using “a academic”, write it as “an academic”, for correct grammar.</p>
				<p class="firstLine">Can I use other people’s story ideas in my own writing?</p>
				<p class="description1">Speak to the writer in question about it. If they say no, then respect that wish. As in, do not directly plagiarize them. You may still loosely base an idea off another work, if you are not copying them beat by beat. A good rule of thumb is if it seems like their story, then it probably is their story. Remember, with 2000+ years of human history, it is near impossible to have a unique idea. Although it is easy to copy someone scene for scene. So, do not do that unless someone gives permission and if they do, cite them, if nothing else, then to cover your own self.</p>
				<p class="firstLine">I paid for the yearly membership, but no one talks to me?</p>
				<p class="description1">The cheeky response would be to look at the “hooking” page and consider what you are doing wrong. However, it could also be the time of year. Is it a major holiday or leading up to one? If so, people may be busy with their lives, and unable to devote time to writing. There could be several reasons why. If you are in doubt, then make a post on the forum about the subject and see if you can connect with some people. You may find people are shy!</p>
				<p class="firstLine">I am really bad at writing and I want to get better, but I am afraid to ask someone how?</p>
				<p class="description1">You are in luck! Most people who are good writers were once not-so-good writers. Whether you are someone who does not understand the basics or are merely looking to polish up on your writing skills, there are a lot of ways to go about this. The sections listed under the “editing” page is the first place I would go. There are many basic elements of writing there that can help polish your work and make it look more appealing to others.</p>
				<p class="firstLine">I need more resources for writing academic and professional papers where can I go?</p>
				<p class="description1">Many writers find the need for extra writing resources. Don't be alarmed if one site doesn't serve all your purposes. However; be aware that not all resources are equally valuable or valid. Here at the Silver Pen Guild we are very selective in what we suggest to our members and visitors. We will expand external resources that are avaialable to you as we validate them for you. An excellent writing resource is the <a id="internallink" href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/purdue_owl.html">Purdue Online Writing Lab.</a></p>
