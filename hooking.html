					<p class="description1">
					The most important aspect of writing is the ability to hook the reader in. This applies to any kind of writing that there is. Have you ever read a topic that you know you are interested in, but the source material is so dry, that it feels painful to read? This is most likely because the writer wrote in such a way that it did not effectively capture the reader.
					<br><br>
					The art of the hook is one that will only come with practice, through trial and error. What we can look at as an example, is the mere title of this page. The word “hooking” can apply to so many different things. It does something to the human mind; it captures the imagination. Using word choice, one can more easily draw someone in, and cause them to wonder. In the case of this page, the choice of word was to draw you, the reader, in to see what the topic is about.
					<br><br>
					Often people use arbitrary gimmicks to draw someone in. Let us call this the “used car salesman” approach. This is often executed through some elaborate display to draw attention and then focus someone down with excessive and useless information. Such an approach will leave the consumer with a want for the nearest exit, rather than sticking around to see what you have to offer.
					<br><br>	
					This page will help elaborate further on the subject. However, it has many facets, and as such, it cannot be covered in just this segment alone. Therefore, we have listed categories on the left-hand side, so that you may dig a little deeper, and hopefully find the golden reason as to why you may not be drawing in the crowds that you would like.
