						The protagonist and antagonist are the two most important characters. The protagonist is the character which is the hero of the story. They, for whatever reasons, are facing hardships, and must overcome. The hardships generally are supported by the antagonist or the villain of the story. Conflict drives a story and these two entities do most of the driving, in the form of a head on collision.
                        <br><br>
                        Perhaps the most difficult part is in knowing how to have this collision occur, without it happening immediately. The story needs to be prolonged to truly be a story but knowing how to prolong it without seeming like filler is a necessary skill. This is where supporting characters come into play. They can create or destroy a situation and cause the entire framework of a given series of events to shift entirely in a different direction.
                        <br><br>
                        One way of doing this is to have a supporting character deescalate a conflict by taking one of the main characters away. Perhaps a fight was about to ensue, but the friend of the main character said that they have class soon and need to be on their way. This effectively delays the conflict that would have otherwise gone on to its climax. As well, it is not a forced situation, as the concept is easily applied to a real-life situation that is easy to imagine.
