						The creating writing process can be approached in a myriad of different ways. Though through all these ways, the fundamentals remain the same. You need to be able to formulate an idea and then express it into the medium of your choice. What seems like a simple task can become daunting once you sit down to do your work.
                        <br><br>
                        Everyone has a different method which they use to write and more importantly, keep motivation in the task. When concerning academics, this is generally an easy task, because of the time clock issue. Due to a set deadline that a person needs to meet, they are essentially forced to write or potentially fail their class, which would result in wasted time, and retaking the same subject they have already done once before. This is a very solid way to be motivated, but it is easy to see how this would not translate to a situation where there is no set deadline imposed upon the individual. Instead, the means to keep motivated must come from the self, rather than an outside force.
                        <br><br>
                        Start the writing process, by not writing at all. First you need to consider what it is that allows you to write, what kinds of things are distractions, and what kinds of things cloud the mind. Make a list of these things, so that you know what to avoid. This is because, in a general sense, people can become easily distracted by one small thing and then it snowballs into something completely different. Having a list of course will not stop this completely, but knowing the pitfalls is part of the battle.
                        <br><br>
                        Once you have that done, move onto the setting of the writing. Where you write matters a great deal, for a few reasons. The first and foremost is comfort. If you are expecting to be writing for a long session, you will want to be the most comfortable. Although, due to the point of distractions made above, it may be a good idea to choose a location that is not around the home. Instead, find a place where you can write, but also where there is a reliable power source nearby. If you require research to do the writing, ensure that you have most of the relevant pieces stored on a flash drive before embarking upon your writing vision quest. As, coming up empty when you need an important piece of material, can break flow entirely.
                        <br><br>
                        Flow has been mentioned a few times here and in other segments. What is flow? Flow is when you start a task, whatever it may be, and time seems to slip through the fingers. Flow is generally a positive experience, but exceptions do exist. Flow tends to be acquired when really getting absorbed into a task, allowing extreme levels of work to be done, when it would otherwise be a daunting task due to lack of motivations and so forth.
