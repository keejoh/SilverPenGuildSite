                       Dialogue is a grey area. There is some formatting to keep in mind. Things such as:
                        <br><br>
                       “To whom it may concern.” The lawyer opened the letter. “I must inform you all gathered here today.”
                        <br><br>
                        “But why though?”
                        <br><br>
                       In the above example, we can see that one character is speaking and then is interrupted by a second character. When doing dialogue, you want to keep blocks of information together about a specific character’s action. As well, when emoting a character’s action between dialogue points, it is important to remain consistent with grammar.
                        <br><br>
                        As far as writing good dialogue, think about how you speak. Sometimes a naturally flowing dialogue will not have perfect syntax, because of how a certain character or dialogue is carried out. However, if writing a fiction, it is important not to write a character which is so difficult to understand, that the reader finds it near impossible to parse. This often comes up with accents. Such as:
                        <br><br>
                        “Aye, I seens that, I did.”
                        <br><br>
                        “Aye, I s’ tha’ I d’.”
                        <br><br>
                        In the second example, even though the two characters are saying the same thing, the first is much easier to read, but also provides enough context clues that the speaker might be using an accent. This is further able to be gathered with consistent dialogue, as speech helps to shape a character and their interactions. The writer could also have other characters remark upon an accent if it is not clear. Though the lesson to take away is that accents are good, but they do not need to be represented verbatim.
                        <br><br>
                        A last point of note is that characters do not write things in the same accent that they speak. This seems intuitive from a first glance, but it is a pitfall that many writers have fallen into. It creates a weird narrative, that when dissected, makes little sense, and shows a lack of awareness with how language works.
