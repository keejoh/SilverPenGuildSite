					Proofreading is a truly important process. There are many reasons why. The first and foremost is that human nature makes it very easy to write someone off (puns can be hooks too!) who is making frequent typos or has such a poor syntax that it makes it difficult to understand what the person is saying. This is generally not some sort of elitism, but rather, basic standards of literary function that has been established in today’s social media driven world.
					<br><br>
					People are expected to perform at a certain level. In olden days, before the advent of the internet, people had to focus mostly upon their appearance. First impressions matter and help a lot in getting a second impression. The major difference between then and now is that much of the way we digest media and interact with others is upon a digital platform, where the written word is paramount. 	
					<br><br>
					This is not to say that someone needs to have utter mastery over their written skills. However, it is stating that in the same way one makes sure their shirt is clean to appear approachable, one should also ensure their writing is clean to ensure others would not mind reading what someone has to say. If it becomes a chore, then it is very easy to ignore or skim over what someone has wrote, no matter what its importance might be.
					<br><br>
					One must be aware of what they are putting out into the world and how others perceive them. This is where proofreading comes into play. For example, take someone who makes the all-too-common mistake of typing “teh" instead of “the”, but they do not have the patience to use spellchecker to correct it. One time might be overlooked. However, if someone is in consistent conversation with the person, that will start to be noticed more and more often. Humans have a habit of seeing patterns as well. One misspelling may lead to noticing someone does not capitalize there “i"s or use “there” in the wrong context like we just did. The segment “capitalize there” should have been “capitalize their”, as “their” is attributed to belonging, whereas “there” is attributing to a location. People take this stuff seriously, whether it be consciously or subconsciously, and it is good practice to know what people see.
