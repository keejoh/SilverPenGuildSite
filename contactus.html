				Here at the Silver Pen Guild, we strive to have open communications with those who have an interest in what we have to offer. Due to this, we have a few ways that we might be directly contacted.
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>General Questions <p>If you need something answered that is not found in the Q&A section, please ask and we will be back with you as soon as possible. General nonsense queries will be placed into the spam folder and repeated nonsense queries will lead to a blocked email. This is not to be harsh, but due to needing to get to people who really need help, without having to filter through a bunch of spam. We thank you for your understanding!</p>
				</li>
				<li>Thoughts & Commentary<p>If you have ideas that might improve the site or just want to show your appreciation, then please leave us a message. We cannot reply to them all, but they are appreciated, and hopefully the suggestions will make for a better experience for everyone. Thank you for your contributions!</p>
				</li>
				<li>Employment Questions<p>When we hire, we will have listings made available. On the homepage, there will be a button labeled as “currently hiring”, which when clicked, will link you to the section of currently available jobs. With that said, we also offer the ability to market your stories on the site, so that you can earn in a free market setting. Thus, you may make currency without being directly employed by us. This requires a membership to access the forums.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Incident Reporting<p>Harassment is not welcome. Innocent messing around is fine, but if someone is quite clearly telling someone else to stop bothering them and it does not stop, then that is harassment. Know that screenshots will need to be provided for the incidents in question, otherwise little can be done to act upon the situation. </p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="description1">
				Screenshots need to contain the offending material, but also a bit before and after the offending material, to ensure that cherry picking from a conversation is not occurring. This is to both protect you and other parties involved.
				<br><br>
				Note that just because someone has a difference of opinion, politics, or social dogma than you or someone else is not grounds for harassment. If someone writes a story about a topic that particularly makes you uncomfortable, then it is suggested to not read that story. Although if it is a story specifically targeting someone in the community, then that is fine to report. Bear in mind, evidence will still be required for that.
