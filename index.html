						What has led you here? Well, that’s a story, isn’t it? That is what this site is all about. Fostering creativity and engineering the writing process. There could be a myriad of reasons as to why you could have come. The most popular of which are located on the toolbar above.
						<br><br>
						We are a company which focuses primarily on the writing process, creating ideas for it, proofreading it, and offering ways to better capture the reader. These things apply to all fields of writing. Whether you are a journalist, non-fiction, fiction, adult, scientific, or any other form of writer, these fields apply.
						<br><br>
						You might be a fresh writer, new to your craft or a veteran looking for some good information for your next great epic. We would like to say, this is a place for you. We have useful information for both novice and experienced writers both. Whichever you are, we hope that you find our services of some use. If you do not, feel free to contact us and let you know how we could improve or what kind of thing you would like to see added.
						<br><br>
						Concerning this part of the project "Research the marketing methods of the company", my methods thus far have mostly been word of mouth. Although I have also posted ads on a few sites over the past couple years. Although the returns from that have been minimal. The ads were featured as clickable links with some disposable artwork. Not particularly eye-catching.
